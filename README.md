# gantt-chart
A Gantt chart , commonly used in project management, is one of the most popular and useful ways of showing activities displayed against time.  I designed a set of C++11 classes to read, store, and process a large directed acyclic graph representing a Gantt Chart. The task are represented as edges and the milestones as vertices. The input files will be task lists. The first three lines will contain a project title, milestone count, and source node (in that order). The output will be Graph Information, Dependency Statistics (In-Degree/Out-Degree), Topological Sort, Articulation Points, Critical Path, Slack Time, and the optional printing of the graph. The data structure of my choice was this project was a custom linked queue. This was our final project where we had 0 guidance in order to develop this Gantt Chart. The class was competing for the most efficient solution (shortest time to complete the task at hand), even with that obstacle I placed 2nd out of 35 students in my Data Structures class at UNLV. My implementation was 15% faster than my colleagues especially because I took the time to implement a reversed linked list causing my insert to be O(1) instead of everyone else O(n) normal linked list implementation.
